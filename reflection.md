This talk was an eye-opening experience that emphasized the importance of both technical and soft skills in the consulting industry. I learned that communication, teamwork, and adaptability are just as critical as technical expertise. I also realized the value of choosing mentors and peers wisely, as they can shape our career paths and personal growth. This talk motivated me to consider applying for such companies after graduation or perhaps pursuing an internship with EY to gain valuable experience.
